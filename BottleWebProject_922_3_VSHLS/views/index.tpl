        <h2>Hamiltonian Cycle</h2>
        <p>The Hamiltonian path problem and the Hamiltonian cycle problem are problems of determining whether there is a Hamiltonian path or a Hamiltonian cycle in a given graph.

        <h2>The Euler cycle</h2>
        <p>The Euler path (chain) passes through each edge of the graph exactly once. An Euler cycle is a closed path that passes through each edge of the graph exactly once. Finding the Euler cycle.</p>

        <h2>Dijkstra's algorithm</h2>
        <p>A graph algorithm invented by the Dutch scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1959. Finds the shortest paths from one of the vertices of the graph to all the others. The algorithm works only for graphs without edges of negative weight.</p>

        <h2>Floyd's algorithm</h2>
        <p>An algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights. In one execution of the algorithm, the lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices will be found.</p>
